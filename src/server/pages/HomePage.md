# Introduction to Audio Source
The Audio Source Composer is an [Open-Source](https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer)
Digital Audio Workstation (DAW) built on the
[WebAudioAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
to work on all platforms; from browsers to desktops to mobile devices.


The main goal of the AudioSource Project is to provide an easy all-platform music composer pre-loaded with as many free sample libraries we can compile.
This allows aficionados of all music to not only listen, but explore the 'source' of the music they love, and hopefully be inspired to write music of their own.

Open-Source means the AudioSource project is free forever, and anyone can join in the development.
This means testers, artists, and all kinds of musician are welcome to 
[contribute](https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer/issues/4).

Additionally, the AudioSource website will allow user submissions of composed songs, much like other music sites offer.
The main difference is that songs written in Audio Source Composer will allow users to not only render the song, but view it's source.

*Currently*, the composer is in
[active development](https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer)
and has not yet been released.
Check back for updates as we get closer to the Beta release!
