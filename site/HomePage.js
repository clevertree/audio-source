                    The main goal of the AudioSource project is to provide an easy all-platform music composer pre-loaded with as many free sample libraries we can compile.{'\n'}
                    This allows aficionados of all music to not only listen, but explore the 'source' of the music they love, and hopefully be inspired to write music of their own.{'\n'}

                    Open-Source means the AudioSource project is free forever, and anyone can join in the development,{'\n'}
                    so we're always looking for testers, artists, and all kinds of musician to {'\n'}
                    <HTML.A href="https://github.com/clevertree/audio-source-composer/issues/4">contribute</HTML.A>.

                    Additionally the AudioSource website will allow user submissions of composed songs, much like other music sites offer.{'\n'}
                    The main difference is that songs written in Audio Source Composer will allow users to not only render the song, but view it's source.{'\n'}
