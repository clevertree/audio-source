# Audio Source Composer
[AudioSource.io](https://audiosource.io/)

The Audio Source Composer is an Open-Source Digital Audio Workstation 
built on the [WebAudioAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
to work on all platforms from web browsers to desktops applications to mobile devices.


## Features:
* Works on any modern browser on any phone, tablet or pc.
* Instruments and Effects can be wrapped in each other to build complex presets.
* Note tracks can be called recursively for a highly structured song.

## What's Currently Working:
* Add, edit, and delete notes and note tracks.
* Edit note velocity and duration.
* Quarter Tone Compatibility (missing in MIDI)
* Recursively play back tracks by adding a 'Track Note'.
* Track Note Transposing (play back tracks at different frequencies)

## Under the Hood:
* Audio Source brings the WebAudio API to mobile by using a WebView as a proxy.
* Songs, instruments, and samples written for Audio Source will work on any platform. 
* Instruments render using React VirtualDOM on the UI thread while rendering audio in the WebView proxy. 

## Planned Features:
* Sample libraries
* Audio recording and editing
* Track XY Grid for easy mouse-click composition
* Real-time editing between multiple users (like Google Docs)
* Server-side song rendering
* Import/Export MIDI files
