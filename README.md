# Audio Source Composer
https://audiosource.io/ 

The Audio Source Composer is an Open-Source Digital Audio Workstation 
built on the [WebAudioAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)

## What's Currently Working:

* Recursively play-back note tracks
* Note velocity, duration, sample key ranges

* Hierarchical track views 
* Works on any modern browser on any phone, tablet or pc

## Planned Features:
* Import MIDI files
* Audio recording and editing
* Track XY Grid for easy mouse-click composition
* Real-time editing between multiple users (like Google Docs)
* Server-side song rendering
* Export MIDI files
