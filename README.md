# Audio Source Composer
https://audiosource.io/ 

The Audio Source Composer is an Open-Source Digital Audio Workstation 
built on the [WebAudioAPI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API)
to work on all platforms from web browsers to desktops applications to mobile devices.


## What's Currently Working:
* Add, edit, and delete notes and tracks
* Recursively play-back note tracks & Hierarchical track views
* Edit Note velocity and duration
* OOP-oriented Instruments and Effects can be wrapped in each other to build complex presets
* Works on any modern browser on any phone, tablet or pc

## WebAudio for Mobile Devices:
* Audio Source brings the WebAudio API to mobile by using a WebView as a proxy.
* Songs, instruments, and samples written for Audio Source will work on any platform. 
* Instruments render responsive UI on the UI threat while rendering audio in the WebView proxy. 

## Planned Features:
* Import MIDI files
* Audio recording and editing
* Track XY Grid for easy mouse-click composition
* Real-time editing between multiple users (like Google Docs)
* Server-side song rendering
* Export as MIDI files
